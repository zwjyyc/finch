Some functions are adapted from [Kyubyong's](https://github.com/Kyubyong/transformer) work, thanks for him!

* Based on that, we have:
    * implemented the model under the architecture of ```tf.estimator.Estimator``` API

    * added an option to share the weights between encoder embedding and decoder embedding

    * added an option to share the weights between decoder embedding and output projection

    * added the learning rate variation according to the formula in paper, and also expotential decay

    * added more activation choices (leaky relu / elu) for easier gradient propagation

    * enhanced masking (mask positional encoding as well)

    * implemented decoding on graph and added start tokens

* Small Task 1: learn sorting characters

    ``` python train_letters.py ```
        
    ```

    common -> cmmnoo
    zhedong -> deghnoz
    ```

* Small Task 2: learn chinese dialog

    ``` python train_dialog.py```
    
    ```
    INFO:tensorflow:loss = 3.48946, step = 7001 (19.987 sec)
